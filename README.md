# Knowing about two shells (mode) of python 

Basics before starting to code in python 

<br>

`
Python has two modes to work on with, first it has the interactive mode which is used for generating simple outputs and second the script mode which is used for making many complex programs, also here script mode is necessary to for lengthy programs because in the interactive mode the outputs of the statements are rather compressed between the statements and in the interactive mode the output can be obtained by pressing F5 on our keyboard whenever we are done coding 
`

<br>

The Interactive Mode (Shell) looks somewhat like this -

And The Script Mode (Shell) looks somewhat like this -

```
</a>

<br>

Let's start with some basic program in the interactive mode after that we would be moving to the script mode
|----|
# Commad to print Hello World in Python in the interactive mode 

```
print("Hello World")
```

After typing this the output comes in this format

Hello World 
|---|

Please note that there is a difference between `Print` & `print`,
You can find more information about keywords of python here -

<a href="https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/keyword-list">

```
https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/keyword-list
```
</a>

# Now Let's create a simple hello world programe in the script mode 

To open the script shell, just press
```
Ctrl + N
```

On your keyboard

And then the script shell will open

After that type the code below to get the output -

```
print("Hello World")
```

Or you can assign Hello World to a variable and print the value of the variable by the following code -

```
mytext = "Hello World"
print (mytext)
```
